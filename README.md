# Military Objects Recognition

This project implements a system for automatic recognition and classification of military objects (tanks, aircrafts, helicopters, etc.) from images captured in natural environments using the YOLOv8 architecture.

The goal is to develop a robust model that:
- Detects object locations (bounding boxes)
- Classifies them into one of 12 classes
- Operates efficiently in real-time
